# Data-Mining-Project

This is Team Microsoft's Data Mining Project, for the Data Mining and Machine Learning class of Professor Vlachos, during Autumn 2020 semester at the University of Lausanne.

#### Weekly Updates

Week 0 - 16 Nov: 

- Set up a Repository on GitHub for the Data Mining Project
- Set up the code, data, documents files
- Provided a brief description of the repository in the README.md
- Invited fellow team members
- Created the GitHub URL for the project
- Created an Account on AIcrowd
- Joined the DM&ML challenge
- Invited fellow team members

Week 1 - 23 Nov:

- Upload Data
- Begin coding process: base rate, cleaning, model training, etc.
- Construct a first classifier model (logistic regression)
- First set of predictions made
- Revised code in order to slightly improve accuracy of initial prediction
- Conducted 3 furthers tests with Logistic Regression functions, without improving accuracy results
- Working to clean up some of the key words in the data set and thus further improve the prediction's accuracy

Week 2 - 30 Nov:

- EDA additions
- Additional work on the Cleaning of the Data by working on location feature engineering
- Making a start on kNN & decision tree processes
- Aesthetic Improvements

Week 3 - 7 Dec:

- Addition of feature engineering
- Working to increase accuracy through further Data Cleaning methods
- Reorganisation of booklet
- Working to increase accuracy by working on the location feature in the classifier
- Working to increase accuracy by using hyperparameter tuning
- Comparison of different classifier methods to find best accuracy

Week 4 - 14 Dec - Final Week:

- Final refinements to code: additional cleaning, accuracy improvements, improving the structure of the code, increasing clarity with explanations regarding the code
- Class presentation preparations
- Video recording explaining code begun
