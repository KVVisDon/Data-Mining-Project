# Data Mining Project

# DMML Fall 2020 - University of Lausanne


#### Description
This is Team Microsoft's Data Mining Project for the Data Mining and Machine Learning class of Professor Vlachos, in the Fall 2020 semester at the University of Lausanne.
This project was about trying to predict whether a tweet was about a real disaster or not given a dataset of labelled tweets.
We competed in the [AICrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/final-project-of-the-data-mining-and-machine-learning-course) competition linked to this project. Our goal was to train a machine learning model that would have the best possible accuracy once uploaded on the AICrowd platform. Each team only could make 5 submissions per day over the 5 week long competition.

Please note that this project is not affiliated nor endorsed in any way to Microsoft Corporation or its subsidiaries.


#### Data
The training dataset contained 6471 entries, each with an id, keyword, location, text, and target (0 if the tweet is fake, 1 if real).

#### Weekly Updates

##### Week 0 - 16 Nov: 

- Set up a Repository on GitHub for the Data Mining Project
- Set up the code, data, documents files
- Provided a brief description of the repository in the README.md
- Invited fellow team members
- Created the GitHub URL for the project
- Created an Account on AIcrowd
- Joined the DM&ML challenge
- Invited fellow team members

##### Week 1 - 23 Nov:

- Upload Data
- Begin coding process: base rate, cleaning, model training, etc.
- Construct a first classifier model (logistic regression)
- First set of predictions made
- Revised code in order to slightly improve accuracy of initial prediction
- Conducted 3 furthers tests with Logistic Regression functions, without improving accuracy results
- Working to clean up some of the key words in the data set and thus further improve the prediction's accuracy

##### Week 2 - 30 Nov:

- EDA additions
- Additional work on the Cleaning of the Data by working on location feature engineering
- Making a start on kNN & decision tree processes
- Aesthetic Improvements

##### Week 3 - 7 Dec:

- Addition of feature engineering
- Working to increase accuracy through further Data Cleaning methods
- Reorganisation of booklet
- Working to increase accuracy by working on the location feature in the classifier
- Working to increase accuracy by using hyperparameter tuning
- Comparison of different classifier methods to find best accuracy

##### Week 4 - 14 Dec - Final Week:

- Final refinements to code: additional cleaning, accuracy improvements, improving the structure of the code, increasing clarity with explanations regarding the code.
- Class presentation preparations
- Video recording explaining code begun
